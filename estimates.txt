Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the amount of time the application is down.
It is calculated according to the SLA and availability percentage.

Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
Time	Description
00:01	Problem happens (First minute)
00:06	An amount of time passes before an alert triggers (5 mins)
00:07	Automatically switch to second availability zone (1 mins)
Total time is almost 10 minutes

Minimum RTO for a single region outage
Time	Description
00:01	Problem happens (First minute)
00:06	An amount of time passes before an alert triggers (5 mins)
00:07	Alert triggers on-all staff (1 mins)
00:17	On-call staff may need to get out of bed, get to a computer, log in, log onto VPN (10 mins)
00:27	On-call staff starts diagnosing the issue (10 mins)
00:37	Root cause is discovered (10 mins)
00:47	Remediation started (10 mins)
00:52	Issue fixed (5 mins)
Total time is almost 60 mins

Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is the amount of time the data is being lost.
It is calculated according to the database and backup strategy being used.

Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
RDS has a point in time restoration which uploads transactions every 5 minutes in transaction logs.
Thus, if this is case then the most data that would be lost would be 5 minutes.

Minimum RPO for a single region outage
Read replicas aim to be kept up to date with the primary DB so the read replica should have almost the same RPO as the primary DB.
For some critical cases we can consider at most the RPO should be almost 10 mins for a read replica to be promoted.
